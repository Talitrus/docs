:::warning Testing Tokens

All tokens in the preview version of the Helium Wallet App are testing tokens on Solana devnet.
These tokens have no value and should not be traded.

:::

The Helium Wallet App has been updated with a Solana Devnet Preview. With this, you can test the
Solana migration for your wallet and hotspots before it happens. A snapshot was taken January 31st,
2023 of Helium mainnet. All tokens and hotspots on Solana devnet are reflective of this snapshot.

## Enable Solana Preview

On the main screen of the helium walelt app, click the settings cog in the upper left hand corner.

<div className="img-center">
  <img className="appscreenbanner" src={useBaseUrl('img/solana/migration-settings.png')} />
</div>

Then, enable the Solana Preview. You can always disable the Solana preview in the same way to see
your real assets.

## Explore Hotspots

You can now explore your hotspots by clicking the Collectibles Tab. From here, you will be able to
test claiming rewards with testing tokens.

Let us know via discord if you experience any issues!
